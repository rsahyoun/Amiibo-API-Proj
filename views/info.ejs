                Hi! I'm Ryan Sahyoun, the creator of this Amiibo Database website. I built this site to help fans like myself easily access information about their favorite Amiibo characters and figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm passionate about web development and love combining this with my interest in gaming. My goal was to create a user-friendly experience where Amiibo fans could quickly find what they're looking for, without any hassle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore the site, and if you have any feedback or suggestions, I would love to hear from you!
